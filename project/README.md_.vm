This project requires Java 8 to build and run. If you are using Docker you can obtain a clean development environment to use with this project by issuing the following command:

```shell
> docker run -it -p8080:8080 --rm --name ${name} -v "$PWD":/usr/src/${name} -w /usr/src/${name} java:8
```

The commands that follow can then all be entered in the resulting shell.

To run locally

This Spring Boot microservice is driven using Maven. To run locally simply execute the following from the command line:

```shell
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will launch the microservice on port 8080 by default.

------------

This microservice comes with some rudimentary tests as a good starting point for writing your own. Use the following command to execute the tests using Maven:

```shell
> ./mvnw test
```

--------------------------------

You can build, pacakge and run this microservice using Docker right out of the box. First make sure you have build the microservice locally by executing the following Maven command:

```shell
> ./mvnw package
```

Now you have built the necessary artifacts, the next step is to build your docker image. From a terminal where you have access to Docker, execute the following command:

```shell
> docker build -t my_microservice .
```

You can now run your dockerized microservice with the following command:

```shell
> docker run -name my_microservice -i -t my_microservice
```
